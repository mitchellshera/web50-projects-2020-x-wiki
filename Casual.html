<p class="paragraphcasual">Here I will divide the Clothes into two categories: Winter,Spring, Fall and Summer Clothes.</p>
<ul class="aboutlist">
<h1>Winter Fashion Tips</h1>
<p>Winter is a tricky season in the fashion world.When you’re busy worrying about braving the elements and staying warm,
 it can be easy to ignore the laws of fashion and revert to the same heavy coats and bulky sweaters year after year.
But winter clothing can actually be just as fun as fashionable as the rest of the year.</p>

<li>Learn to Layer</li>
Layering can be more than just a chance to stay warm. Plaids layered under other shirts,
 turtlenecks under sweaters, and warm tights under a skirt can brighten your wardrobe
 while also giving you an added layer of protection against the chill.

<li>Let Your Shoes Shine </li>
One part of your winter wardrobe that won’t get covered up are your shoes.
If you want to create an outfit that stands out and is still perfect for trekking across an icy sidewalk, starts with a great pair of boots.

<li>Don’t Let Layers Overwhelm You </li>
A heavy coat piled on over a sweater or two will leave you looking shapeless and disheveled.
Add structure to your outfit by adding a wide belt over your favorite coat or by choosing tailored, long styles that elongate your frame.
</ul>
<ul class="aboutlist">
<h2>Spring Fashion Tips </h2>
<p>Warmer weather means the chance to shed those winter layers.
But wading through all of the pastels and outdated florals to find stylish looks can be intimidating.</p>


<li>Don’t Be Afraid to Mix Prints </li>
One easy way to bring your old prints back into style is to dare to mix and match.
A floral patterned skirt gets a fun update when you pair it with your favorite plaid top.
 A checkered scarf feels fashionable when you pair it with a boldly patterned dress.

<li>Repurpose Summer and Fall Staples</li>
In many parts of the country, spring can last just weeks before the heat of the summer takes hold. If you don’t want to invest in an entire spring wardrobe you’ll only get to wear a few times each year, you can easily repurpose your summer and fall staples.

A sundress feels like spring, but might not be warm enough just yet. Add a long, lightweight cardigan from your fall wardrobe for an easy fix. Longer Bermuda shorts go great with lighter sweaters or a chic long-sleeve top. Add a scarf for a pop of color!

<li>Avoid Anything Too Dark</li>
While you might still be pulling from your winter wardrobe to stay warm in the spring, leave the dark, heavier pieces in the closet. This darker tone will leave you looking drab on those bright spring days.

<ul class="aboutlist">
<h3>Summer Fashion Tips</h3>
<p>The heat of the summer might have you dressing in as little fabric as possible.
But that definitely doesn’t mean that you can ignore any and all fashion tips.</p>

<li>Go Natural</li>
To stay cool and still look chic this summer, stick to fabrics that are lightweight and natural. Cotton, rayon, and linen, especially in lighter colors, will help keep you comfortable even on the hottest days.

Loose fits are also a great way to keep cool. Avoid any clothing that hugs your body too tightly.

<li>Find Shorts That Flatter</li>
With so many shorts styles out there, finding the right one for you can take a lot of time in the fitting room. Whether you find that you love your legs in the lengthy Bermudas or sky-high short shorts, choose a style and stick to it.

<li>Embrace White Sneakers, Jeans, and Tanks</li>
If you want to look fashion-forward for an evening out, a day of exploring, or an afternoon on the beach, opt for white.

White jeans are perfect for a summer eve’s dinner date. White sneakers add a modern look to any day outfit. A flowy white tank will keep you cool while still looking polished.
</ul>
<ul class="aboutlist"><h4>Fall Fashion Tips</h4>
<p>Just like that summer is over and the days are cooling off. With the change comes bursts of colors in the trees in many parts of the country.

Don’t let the chilly weather tempt you towards drab fabrics and boring tones.</p>

<li>Keep Summer Dresses Out</li>
Don’t pack away all of your summer dresses quite yet. Long maxi dresses and skirts can easily make the transition to fall with the addition of a cardigan or jean jacket and boots.

Even a shorter sundress can be fall-ready if you combine them with leggings and the next one on this list.

<li>Get a Great Pair of Booties</li>
Short ankle boots or “booties” have been all the rage for the last few fall fashion season. This year will likely be no different.

With so many options out there, you can easily find a style that matches your own. Then, show them off by pairing them with short dresses and tights, leggings layered under skirts, or with skinny jeans.

<li>Embrace Embroidery</li>
Embroidery is another fun fashion statement that’s been popular in fall styles recently.

If you don’t want to purchase new embroidered pieces, get creative and add your own fun touches to old pieces. You can embroider simple accents on shirts or jackets, or purchase iron-on patches for a similar effect that’s easy to achieve.
</ul>
Fashion Advice to Follow Year-round
Now that you know some fashion advice for every season, it’s time to start picking your own pieces and building your personal style.
