  Skirt or slacks? Tights or bare legs? Sandals or pumps?
  These are the questions you might find yourself asking each morning as you select work attire.
  And, depending on the dress code your company enforces,
 you could be spot on.

            There are various categories of professional women's clothes:
          <ol>
            <li> Business Formal  </li>
            <li>Business Professional</li>
            <li>Business Casual</li>

        <h1>Business Formal</h1>
            Business formal is reserved for the most formal settings such as
            award ceremonies, special dinners, benefits or other important
             evening events.
             Business formal is similar to “black tie,”
            but should be reserved to maintain professionalism.
            For business formal, women might wear a dark pants suit, skirt suit
             or suit dress. In some cases, a long evening dress may be appropriate.
              Shoes options include formal flats, heels, oxfords or loafers.
             Minimalist jewelry can be appropriate.

          <h1>Business Professional</h1>
            Business professional is a traditional form of attire used in more conservative settings or companies with strict dress codes.
            You might wear business professional in industries like accounting, banking, finance, government or law.
             Business professional clothes should be well-fitted and may be tailored to fit you specifically.
             When dressing for business professional, women should wear tidy dresses, skirts or slacks.
              Tops should include neat button-down shirts or blouses with a blazer.
           Business professional shoes include classic heels no higher than three inches, loafers or tidy flats.
              Women can accessorize with minimal jewelry and belts

     <h1>Business Casual </h1>
     Business casual is a common form of dress worn in many offices. Business casual is appropriate for many interviews,
     client meetings and office settings.
      Because it is not very casual and also not very formal,
      this is usually an appropriate way to dress if you’re unsure about the setting.
       For business casual, women can wear pencil skirts, blouses, button-down shirts, trousers, khakis, blazers and sweaters.
       They can accessorize with simple jewelry and belts. Shoes can include flats, loafers, mules, boots or heel

       <h1>Casual </h1>
       Casual business attire is informal clothing worn not only in most business settings but also in many settings outside of work.
        You might wear casual clothing if you work in an informal office where others wear things like t-shirts, jeans and open-toed shoes.
        You should avoid wearing casual dress with clients and in interviews, even if the office is casual overall.
        Casual dress for women includes items like t-shirts, blouses and sweaters on top.
         Bottoms might include jeans, cropped pants or shorts.
        Casual shoes can include sneakers, low heels or sandals.
