ABOUT
This project is about Womens fashion. The two categories; Professional and Casual.
I chose this topic because I am a woman and we all love fashion. I love Fashion.
I have used all required properties , selectors among many others for all the files.
Each file is media responsive such that they are easily visible on smaller screens as
well as larger screens.I have included a footer with my name on it for each file too.
Also, every file has a navbar such that you can navigate from each html file to and from.

1. INDEX.html
This file has my homepage where i have the navbar for navigation around the four html pages
i have used in this project.It has an introduction/welcome message and an image.I have
styled this file with styles.css

This file is all about the professional outfits and the various categories;Business Professional,
Business formal,business casual and casual. I have used bootstrap grids for each of the categories
and each has an image alongside it.Also, i included bootstrap components on the intro alert message.
